### What I learned

I learned how to use the PixelPerfect extension on chrome to accurately pick up on dimensions and pixel sizes. However, what I noticed was that the rendering GPU of the image plays a role, as the antialising happening of the browser itself. An elusive beauty of imperfection, I remembered that there's no need for absolute pixel perfection and it's completely fine to be off for a few ones!
